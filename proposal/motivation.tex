Motivation describes the most important of the related works. The ones that 
you either build on, prove/disprove, or in any way ``extend''. 

Other related work, that is orthogonal to your approach but is in the same
general problem-area, can be included in a separate related work section.
One good place for that is at the end, so it doesn't disrupt the story here.
