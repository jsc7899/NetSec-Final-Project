A great deal of the academic work regarding honeypots is focused on furthering some particular facet of a honeypot. While we certainly have incorporated ideas from such work, ours is primarily motivated by a desire to explore honeypots generally. The goals of our project are to collect as much data as possible and to explore the configuration of a honeypot network.

Additionally, we would like to gain a sense of the types of data we obtain and the high level information we can derive from such data. To this end, an exploration of the data we collect is necessary. This will allow us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various honeypot technologies we utilize. 

%	Mairh, et al. discuss a variety of use-cases for honeypots, among them is the use of a honeypot in conjunction with an Intruder Detection System (IDS). The authors note that an IDS typically uses misuse and anomaly detection [1]. We hope to both implement a system similar to the one described by Mairh, et al. and perform an analysis of the data we collect from the system in accordance with the type of anomaly detection described.

%Additionally, Chuvakin was able to classify individual types of attacks on his system [2]. Such a level of analysis is impressive, and we hope to achieve similar data collection, albeit in a lesser volume due to the significantly shorter time frame. Also, our analysis may be more focused on traffic metrics rather than the sort of in depth log analysis done by Chuvakin. We are more inclined towards determining if and when an attack has occurred rather than what specific attacks occurred.
