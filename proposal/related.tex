Steve Gathof wrote an excellent article on the setup of a honeypot on an AWS EC2 instance [3]. While his work will likely be a useful reference for our architecture, it is not explicitly related to the analysis that we will be performing. 

Additionally, Polyakov et al. explored both the architecture and several specific functions that a honeypot should fulfill [4]. We will try to implement the functions mentioned in the Polyakov's article, in particular, creating variable conditions for accessing the system in order to possibly filter out low level intruders.
