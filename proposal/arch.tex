We have set up a basic Amazon Web Services server. The server is an EC2 t2.micro instance. We are using an Ubuntu Server 18 image as our operating system. 

To create the functionality of the honeypot, we have found several tools which we will configure and test. \href{https://github.com/DinoTools/dionaea}{Dionaea} captures malware and can simulate certain individual vulnerabilities. \href{https://github.com/mushorg/snare}{SNARE} is a web application based honeypot which we plan on using for the face of our honeypot. 

For data analysis we will mainly use Python to graph trends. \href{https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/}{Tanner} is another tool we can test which analyzes data specifically from SNARE, mentioned above.
