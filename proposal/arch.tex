We plan to host our honeypot on an Amazon Web Services server. The server will be an EC2 t2.micro instance. We will use an Ubuntu Server 18 image as our operating system. 

To create the functionality of the honeypot, we have found three tools which we will configure and test. \href{https://github.com/desaster/kippo}{Kippo} is a fully functional, medium interaction, SSH based honeypot. \href{https://github.com/DinoTools/dionaea}{Dionaea} captures malware and can simulate certain individual vulnerabilities. \href{https://github.com/mushorg/snare}{SNARE} is a web application based honeypot. 

For data analysis we will mainly use Python to graph trends. \href{https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/}{Tanner} is another tool we can test which analyzes data specifically from SNARE, mentioned above.
