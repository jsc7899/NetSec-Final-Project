In order to research the effectiveness of honeypots, we implemented and configured our own honeypot on an AWS server. Our honeypot collected even more data than we expected over the course of a single week. We have analyzed the data collected by our honeypot to find trends in the origin of attacks, the hardware used for attacks, which services are most heavily targeted, and more. Thus, our research has demonstrated that honeypots are an effective tool for monitoring malicious activity on a network. Our research also shows that honeypots can collect large amounts of data on many different types of trends. The data collected by a honeypot can be tailored to suit any organizations specific needs, making honeypots an effective tool not only for research, but also for securing enterprise environments.
