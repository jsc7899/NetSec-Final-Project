This project aims to build a honeypot server and analyze the data it collects. The goal of a honeypot server is to create vulnerable server on the open internet which we expect will be attacked by malicious actors. These attacks will be logged by the server, then we will analyze the data collected to find common trends in the attacks. Our honeypot will collect data on both an attacking machine and the attacks it directs at the honeypot. Our honeypot server is hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual server instance. The network for the server has been configured to allow all incoming traffic on monitored ports we expect to be targeted (such as SSH). We then analyzed the collected data using Python to find trends in attacker IP addresses, attacker operating systems, attacked ports, and timing of attacks. The honey pot was successful in collecting a large amount of attack data, averaging over 1000 unique data points per day. Our research has determined that a honeypot server is an effective tool for monitoring potential attacks on a network. We have also found honeypots to be highly configurable which allows for the collection of data specific to an organization's needs.
